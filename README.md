# Getting Help

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful

Check [the troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide. I make this for my own use, and share in the hope that others find it useful - I am unable to offer support, or to act on bug reports or feature requests. Do not contact me for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email. This software is used by many, and I do generally fix it when something changes to break it, but I do not guarantee this, and I'm not able to help with anyone's specific issues.

If 'fuzzy matching' is required - or not functioning properly for you - ask your device manufacturer to fix their device/drivers to not change device IDs; Microsoft requires that these do not change.
